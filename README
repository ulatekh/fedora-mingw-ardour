This is a rough list of library dependencies for building Ardour
for windows using the MinGW compiler on Fedora
 
MinGW Fedora Packages that are already packaged and part of Fedora
are preceded by a -

The packages contained in this repository are all the packages that
have not yet been included in Fedora.

The Sources for these packages are not included in this repository
and have to be downloaded separately and put in the SOURCES directory
of the rpmbuild root.

The ~/.rpmmacros file is used to set the path to the rpmbuild root
dir, rather than the default ~/rpmbuild

Jack2 is the only package that requires an unreleased version from
https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2.git

- wine, needed to run some tests during the configure process

- mingw*-gcc

- mingw*-gcc-c++

- mingw*-libogg

build mingw-flac <- requires libogg

- mingw*-libvorbis

build mingw-libsndfile <- requires flac, vorbis
build mingw-libsamplerate <- requires sndfile for examples?

- mingw*-gtkmm24, this will pull in all the gtk+ deps etc

build mingw-gtk2-engines <- provides clearlooks

- mingw*-libglade2, required for gnomecanvas

build mingw-libart_lgpl
build mingw-libgnomecanvas <- requires libart, libglade2
build mingw-libgnomecanvasmm

build mingw-portaudio

build mingw-jack-audio-connection-kit

build mingw-fftw

- mingw*-boost

- mingw*-curl

Optional

- mingw*-cppunit, if tests enabled
- mingw*-gdb, for debugging

- qemu-kvm to run virt images

This repository also contains the dependencies needed to build the MS
Windows version of Mixxx!  See http://www.mixxx.org/ for more info.
(There was so much overlap between Ardour's dependencies and Mixxx's
that it made sense to keep them in one repository.)

Here are the MinGW packages to build, and the built packages they
depend on.

libmad
portmidi
protobuf
libid3tag
taglib
flac
gsm
libsndfile : flac gsm libogg libvorbis
libsamplerate : libsndfile
portaudio
jack-audio-connection-kit : libsamplerate portaudio
kde-filesystem
phonon : kde-filesystem
fftw
libchromaprint : fftw

These are still to be done:

qt : phonon
vamp-plugin-sdk : phonon
hss1394 : phonon

As usual, yum-builddep should be run on the spec file before building,
to bring in dependencies that are already in Fedora's repos (e.g. zlib,
libogg, etc.)

Note that Mixxx's build depends on protobuf-lite-static, so that'll have
to be installed in addition to protobuf.
